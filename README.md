A world map that shows new (and unconfirmed) bitcoin transactions in real-time using Node, D3 and the Blockchain.info web socket API. So far it displays transaction location and amount in USD based on a hardcoded BTC-USD exchange rate. The goal is to have it update using the coinbase api in a future release.
